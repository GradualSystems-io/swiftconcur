**Policy ID:** AC-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** [Date]  
**Review Date:** [Date + 12 months]  
**Owner:** Security Team  
**Approved By:** [Security Officer]

## Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for managing user access to SwiftConcur CI systems and data in accordance with SOC-2 Type II requirements and security best practices.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third parties with access to SwiftConcur systems
- All system accounts and service accounts
- All customer data and internal systems
- All environments (production, staging, development)

## Policy Statement

SwiftConcur implements the principle of least privilege, ensuring users receive only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions. All access is granted based on business need, role requirements, and organizational approval processes.

## Access Control Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions
- Access rights are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as needed
- Temporary elevated privileges require approval and are time-limited (maximum 8 hours)
- Administrative access is separated from regular user accounts

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access is assigned based on predefined roles aligned with job functions
- Standard role definitions:
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned repositories and basic dashboard
  - **Member**: Read/write access to assigned repositories, basic configuration
  - **Admin**: Full access to organization settings, user management, billing
  - **Owner**: Complete administrative control, including organization deletion

### 3. Segregation of Duties
- No single individual has complete control over critical business processes
- Administrative functions require dual approval for sensitive operations
- Financial operations (billing changes) require secondary verification

## User Access Management

### Account Provisioning
1. **Request Process**:
   - All access requests must be submitted through approved channels
   - Requests require manager approval and business justification
   - HR verification of employment status required for new accounts

2. **Account Creation**:
   - User accounts created only after employment verification
   - Default role assignment based on job function
   - Initial password must meet complexity requirements
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled by default

3. **Access Approval**:
   - Manager approval required for all access requests
   - System owner approval required for administrative access
   - Security team approval required for privileged system access

### Account Modification
1. **Role Changes**:
   - Immediate review triggered by role changes
   - Access rights adjusted within 24 hours of role change notification
   - Excess permissions removed promptly

2. **Temporary Access**:
   - Temporary elevated access limited to maximum 8 hours
   - Business justification required
   - Automatic expiration and removal

### Account Deprovisioning
1. **Termination Process**:
   - Accounts disabled immediately upon termination notification
   - All access tokens and API keys revoked
   - SSO accounts deactivated through identity provider

2. **Transfer Process**:

   - Previous role permissions removed within 24 hours
