	•	Avoid Unnecessary Allocations and Copies: Profile the parser to ensure it isn’t performing excessive allocations (which slow down processing). 
    
    For example, if parsing lines, reuse buffers instead of allocating new strings for each line. Use strategies like zero-copy parsing where possible (e.g., use string slices & references into the buffered data rather than creating new String for each token). 
    
    In Rust, libraries like nom or regex can parse text efficiently; just ensure they operate in a streaming fashion.
