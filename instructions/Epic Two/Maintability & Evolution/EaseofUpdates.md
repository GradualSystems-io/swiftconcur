Ease of Updates via AI: To specifically make the codebase easier for AI agents (like Claude) to update, maintain a high-level architecture knowledge base in the repository. 

This could be a markdown file describing each component, config files, and how they tie together (e.g., explain that “Cloudflare Worker calls Rust WASM module for parsing” or “GitHub Action posts log to endpoint X, which triggers Y”). 

When the AI has this context, it’s less likely to make incorrect assumptions. Moreover, keep functions small and focused (following Single Responsibility Principle) – this way, an AI code tool can safely modify one function without unintended side-effects on unrelated logic. 

Strong test coverage, as mentioned, is the safety net – if an AI introduces a bug, tests should catch it. In summary, clarity, modularity, and tests form the environment where AI contributions can be reliable.
