Coding Standards and Static Analysis: Continue using Rust’s Clippy linter and rustfmt. Enforce that the repository is kept tidy and idiomatic. Static analysis catches common mistakes (Clippy will flag unwraps, inefficient clones, etc.), which improves reliability by preventing known pitfalls. Many teams treat Clippy warnings as errors in CI to keep quality high ￼. By keeping the code idiomatic and clean, it’s easier for AI and humans to reason about it and make changes without introducing bugs.
