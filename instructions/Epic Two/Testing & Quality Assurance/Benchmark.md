	•	Benchmark Testing for Parsing Speed: Set up performance tests to ensure the code meets the 100MB/<5s goal. You can use Rust’s built-in benchmark facility (with #[bench] functions) or a framework like Criterion. For example, include a test that measures how quickly a ~100MB sample (or a scaled-down size for CI) is processed. Although this might not run on every CI run (to keep CI fast), you can run it locally or periodically. This ties into the performance goals and ensures you continuously meet speed requirements.
