•	Implement Unit and Integration Tests: Begin writing unit tests for all critical Rust modules (especially the log parser logic). 

Unit tests should cover edge cases of parsing (e.g., unusual log lines, very large inputs in a simulated way) to ensure the parser doesn’t panic or mis-compute results. 

Additionally, implement integration tests that exercise the system end-to-end (for example, using a fixture log file, run the parsing function and verify it produces expected database entries or API outputs). 

Both kinds of tests are important – unit tests validate components in isolation, and integration tests ensure they work together.
