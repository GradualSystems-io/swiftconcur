•	Include Negative/Failure Tests: Add tests for expected failure modes – e.g., if a corrupted or unsupported log file is given, does the parser return a graceful error instead of panicking? 

Ensure that authentication logic is also testable: for instance, simulate an API call with an invalid token and verify it’s rejected. 

These tests improve reliability by verifying the system behaves correctly under adverse conditions.
