Observability for Reliability: Build observability into the system. For example, add structured logging in the Cloudflare Worker and the Rust parser for key events (start parsing, parsing completed, number of issues found, etc.). 

Use a logging crate like tracing in Rust, which can be compiled to WASM as well, to produce logs that can be collected. If possible, integrate with a monitoring service (Cloudflare Workers can send logs to a Logpush endpoint or external logging service). 

Also instrument metrics: e.g., track processing time per file, memory usage, etc. Observability helps you detect reliability issues early and guide evolutionary improvements (fitness functions for architecture fitness, as the evolutionary architecture concept suggests ï¿¼).
