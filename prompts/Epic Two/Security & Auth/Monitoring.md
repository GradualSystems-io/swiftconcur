â€¢	Monitoring and Alerts: For security (and reliability), set up monitoring. 

Cloudflare Workers provide logs and can integrate with alerting (for example, log to a service or use Sentry). 

Monitor for unusual activities, such as a sudden spike in log size uploads or many failed auth attempts, and have alerts to investigate potential abuse or attacks. Rate-limit if necessary (Cloudflare can help rate-limit at the edge) to prevent denial-of-service via massive log submissions.
