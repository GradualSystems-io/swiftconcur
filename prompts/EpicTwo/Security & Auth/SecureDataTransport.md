	â€¢	Secure Data Transport and Storage: Ensure all communication is over HTTPS (Cloudflare ensures this by default for Workers, and Supabase endpoints are TLS secured). 
    
    Verify that the Cloudflare Worker only accepts requests from authorized sources (for instance, if the GitHub Action calls a particular endpoint to upload logs, consider using an authentication token or API key in that request as well). 
    
    On Supabase, prefer using the officially supported clients or REST with the provided API keys and never exposing the service_role key on the client side.
