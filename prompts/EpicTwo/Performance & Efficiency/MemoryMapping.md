    Rust has crates like memmap2 that map a file into memory directly. This avoids copying file data through the kernel-user space boundary repeatedly. 
    
    A memory-mapped approach can treat the file as a byte slice and scan through it quickly. This technique has been used to analyze multi-GB logs in seconds in Rust. 
    
    If the deployment environment permits (e.g., on the GitHub Action or a server with an OS), consider this for maximum throughput. (Note: Cloudflare Workers in WASM might not support true OS memmap; if that’s where parsing occurs, stick to buffered streaming).
