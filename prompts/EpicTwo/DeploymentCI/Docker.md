	â€¢	Docker Image Optimization: If using a Docker container in the GitHub Action (e.g., for the parsing step), optimize the Dockerfile. Use a slim base image (e.g., Rust official slim image) and multi-stage builds to keep the image small and secure. 
    
    This will speed up CI pulls and reduce attack surface. Additionally, pin versions of base images and dependencies for reproducible builds.
