	•	Continuous Delivery to Cloudflare Workers: Automate deployment of the Cloudflare Worker via CI/CD when tests pass. Use tools like Cloudflare’s Wrangler CLI in the GitHub Action to build and publish the Worker. 
    
    Ensure the Worker’s build (if it involves compiling Rust to WASM or bundling) is included in the CI process. 
    
    Automating deployment reduces manual errors and improves reliability of releases.
