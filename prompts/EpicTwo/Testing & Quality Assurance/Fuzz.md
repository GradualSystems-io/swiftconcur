	•	Property-Based and Fuzz Testing: To further improve reliability, consider fuzz testing the log parser. Using cargo-fuzz (which is the recommended tool for fuzzing Rust code ￼), you can generate random log-like inputs to try to break the parser (find panics or infinite loops). Fuzz tests catch edge cases that may not be covered by hand-written tests, improving the parser’s robustness against malformed or unexpected input.
