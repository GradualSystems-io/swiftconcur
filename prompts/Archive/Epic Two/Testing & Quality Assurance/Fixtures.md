	â€¢	Use Test Fixtures for Realistic Data: Leverage the files in parser/tests/fixtures/ (various xcodebuild outputs) as test inputs. Write integration tests that read these fixture files and feed them to the parser, then assert that the results (e.g., a structured summary of the build) match expected values. This helps ensure reliability with real-world data samples. Organize these tests under a tests/ directory for clarity (Rust will treat them as integration tests).
