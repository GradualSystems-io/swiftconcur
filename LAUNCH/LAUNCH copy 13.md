Day 12: Ship & measure
	•	Flip “public” switches: marketplace listing, pricing on site, demo live.
	•	Instrument key events: install, first_analysis, pr_comment_view, dashboard_view, subscribe.
	•	Create a daily metrics doc (7-day rolling): installs, activations (PR analyzed), DAU, conversions, top errors.
	•	Set up weekly email to yourself: “What did users do/struggle with?”

DoD: First user can self-serve from homepage → PR comment → dashboard → paid.
