Day 10: Demo & content
	•	Record 2-min demo video: install → PR → dashboard.
	•	Write 1 blog post: “Actor-isolation warnings: what they mean & how to burn them down” with real examples.
	•	Add sample repo (intentionally includes warnings, long build) with a ready workflow.

DoD: You can watch the demo end-to-end and it mirrors the current UI.
