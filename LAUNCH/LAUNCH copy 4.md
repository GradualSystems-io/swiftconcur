Day 3: Observability & stability
	•	Add Sentry (API + dashboard).
	•	Add request IDs + structured logs (API).
	•	Latency/parse-time histogram (simple metrics).
	•	Rate limiting/backoff on webhooks.
	•	Hard cap + graceful truncation message for very large logs.

DoD: You can trace a failing request end-to-end in Sentry.
