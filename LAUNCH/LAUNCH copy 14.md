Post-launch (backlog to pull when you have signal)
	•	Enterprise: SSO request waitlist, DPA on request, on-prem roadmap page.
	•	Non-blocking sec scans (Trivy/cargo-audit) that comment on PRs but don’t fail builds.
	•	Perf budgets and coverage (if customers ask).
	•	Deeper insights: flaky test detector, module build hot-spots, time-to-first-test.

Working notes / pro tips
	•	Keep PR comment sacred: it is the product for 80% of users.
	•	Prefer boring tech over cleverness (especially around billing/auth).
	•	Measure daily; change one thing at a time.
	•	If you get stuck >2 hours on any task, skip and keep momentum—you can backfill later.
