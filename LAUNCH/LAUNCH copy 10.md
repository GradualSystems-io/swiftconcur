Day 9: Marketplace + compliance basics
	•	GitHub Marketplace listing: description, screenshots, pricing tiers, keywords (swift, xcode, concurrency, build time).
	•	Terms of Service (short), Refund policy (14-day), Privacy (from Day 4). (Not legal advice; keep it simple & honest.)
	•	Public Status page (even a JSON view + UptimeRobot).
	•	Verify cookie/banner if you use analytics.

DoD: Listing submitted; links from landing page point to legal pages.
