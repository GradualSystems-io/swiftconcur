Day 11: Outreach machinery
	•	Build lead list (≥100): iOS leads/dev-infra at seed–Series B.
	•	Personalize 20/day messages (email/LinkedIn/X). Use this:
“We analyze xcodebuild logs to surface actor-isolation warnings & build-time regressions in your PR checks. No source stored; logs ephemeral. Install in ~2 minutes. Want me to enable it on a sample PR so you can see the comment?”
	•	Post in: iOS Dev Weekly submission, r/iOSProgramming launch thread, relevant Discord/Slack groups.
	•	Add a “Founders note” on landing: why you built this.
