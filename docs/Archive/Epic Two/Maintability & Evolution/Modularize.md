	•	Modularize the Codebase: Structure the Rust code into clear modules or crates to separate concerns – for example, a module for parsing, one for interacting with Supabase (database logic), one for the Cloudflare Worker interface (if using Rust in WASM, this could be separate from core logic). 
    
    This separation makes it easier to update one part without affecting others. It also aids testability (e.g., you can test the parser module without needing the database). 
    
    A modular architecture supports evolutionary changes over time ￼ – you can swap out or refactor one component (say, change the database or add a new log format) with minimal impact elsewhere.
