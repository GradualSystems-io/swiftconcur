	•	Parallelize Parsing (if possible): Investigate if the parsing work can be parallelized.
    
    Rust’s concurrency could allow splitting the log into sections and processing in threads (especially if the log format can be segmented). 
    
    According to benchmarks, concurrent reads can be significantly faster – one test saw ~3× speedup using 10 threads over a single-threaded buffered read. 
    
    If the environment (GitHub Action or wherever parsing runs) has multiple CPU cores, using threads with careful workload splitting might achieve the <5s goal. Be mindful of overhead and combine results at the end. (If running in Cloudflare Workers, true threads may not be available, but if the heavy work is in the GitHub Action, threads are fine).
