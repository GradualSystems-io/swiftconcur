•	Leverage Cloudflare Worker Features: To meet the API response time (<500ms) while handling large data, consider making the log processing asynchronous. 

For example, the GitHub Action could pre-process the log and send only summarized results to the Worker, so the Worker’s job is quick. If the Worker must handle the raw log, use Cloudflare’s Workers Unbound (which allows longer CPU time) and Streams. 

You could stream the upload of the log to the Worker and process the stream on the fly, sending partial results or storing to the DB as you go, rather than waiting to process everything first. 

This piping can prevent hitting Worker CPU limits and keep memory usage constant. Essentially, design the system so the heavy lifting is done either offline or in a streaming manner, letting the user-facing API remain fast.
