How to use these daily plans
- Track progress by checking items and updating `docs/assistant/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` at the end of each day.
- Keep scope tight; defer anything not on the daily list to post-launch or a later day.

Owner: Aaron
Timebox: 12 days
Dependencies: See per-day docs below; access to required services (GitHub, Stripe, Vercel, Sentry), repo permissions

Day 0 (today): lock scope & baseline
Owner: Aaron
Timebox: 1 day
Dependencies: Repo access, GitHub Actions permissions, ability to tag/branch
	‚Ä¢	Write your MVP contract (1 page): PR check comment + dashboard trends + 1-repo free tier + Stripe checkout. Everything else = post-launch.
	‚Ä¢	Create LAUNCH.md at repo root with this checklist pasted in.
	‚Ä¢	Tag last green commit: v0.1.0-rc1 so you can always roll back.
	‚Ä¢	Turn off non-essential workflows (keep build/test only).
	‚Ä¢	Create ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù branch for work you‚Äôll ship in the next 12 days.

‚∏ª

Day 1: PR check output that sells the value

Checklist
- [ ] Ensure parser returns: total build time, delta vs baseline, count of actor-isolation warnings, new since last PR, and top 3 offenders (file:line)
- [ ] Format PR comment (tight, skimmable):
  - Title + emoji
  - "‚è± Build 18m (+12%) vs baseline"
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è 6 actor-isolation warnings (3 new): A.swift:42, ‚Ä¶"
  - "üîó Details ‚Üí Dashboard"
- [ ] Add status check (success/warn/fail thresholds configurable)
- [ ] Save a golden PR screenshot for landing page/demo

Success criteria: one PR on a sample repo shows the comment exactly as you want customers to see it.

‚∏ª

Day 2: Dashboard "must-haves"

Checklist

- [ ] Build duration chart (sparkline) & warnings trend
- [ ] "New since baseline" section with file:line links
- [ ] Link back to the originating PR/commit
- [ ] Add a /status JSON endpoint (uptime target 99.9)

Success criteria: Demo repo shows data within 2‚Äì3s; no console errors.

‚∏ª

Day 3: Observability & stability

Checklist

Day 4: Privacy, data handling, deletion

Checklist
- [ ] Config flag: don't persist logs (process in-memory) or retain <24h
- [ ] Build Delete-my-data endpoint + admin button
- [ ] Draft Privacy page (plain-English): no source code stored, log retention, data isolation

Success criteria: Hitting the delete endpoint removes all org data and returns 200.

‚∏ª

Day 5: Pricing & billing (Stripe)

Checklist
- [ ] Create Products/Prices in Stripe:
  - Free (1 repo, 200 builds/mo, 7-day history)

Success criteria: You receive a test support email with all context auto-attached.

‚∏ª

Day 9: Marketplace + compliance basics
	‚Ä¢	GitHub Marketplace listing: description, screenshots, pricing tiers, keywords (swift, xcode, concurrency, build time).
	‚Ä¢	Terms of Service (short), Refund policy (14-day), Privacy (from Day 4). (Not legal advice; keep it simple & honest.)
	‚Ä¢	Public Status page (even a JSON view + UptimeRobot).

‚∏ª

DoD: You can watch the demo end-to-end and it mirrors the current UI.

‚∏ª

Day 11: Outreach machinery
	‚Ä¢	Build lead list (‚â•100): iOS leads/dev-infra at seed‚ÄìSeries B.
	‚Ä¢	Personalize 20/day messages (email/LinkedIn/X). Use this:
‚ÄúWe analyze xcodebuild logs to surface actor-isolation warnings & build-time regressions in your PR checks. No source stored; logs ephemeral. Install in ~2 minutes. Want me to enable it on a sample PR so you can see the comment?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Post in: iOS Dev Weekly submission, r/iOSProgramming launch thread, relevant Discord/Slack groups.
	‚Ä¢	Add a ‚ÄúFounders note‚Äù on landing: why you built this.

DoD: 20 personalized messages sent; 2 community posts live.

‚∏ª

Day 12: Ship & measure
	‚Ä¢	Flip ‚Äúpublic‚Äù switches: marketplace listing, pricing on site, demo live.
	‚Ä¢	Instrument key events: install, first_analysis, pr_comment_view, dashboard_view, subscribe.
	‚Ä¢	Create a daily metrics doc (7-day rolling): installs, activations (PR analyzed), DAU, conversions, top errors.
	‚Ä¢	Set up weekly email to yourself: ‚ÄúWhat did users do/struggle with?‚Äù

DoD: First user can self-serve from homepage ‚Üí PR comment ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí paid.

‚∏ª

Post-launch (backlog to pull when you have signal)
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise: SSO request waitlist, DPA on request, on-prem roadmap page.
	‚Ä¢	Non-blocking sec scans (Trivy/cargo-audit) that comment on PRs but don‚Äôt fail builds.
	‚Ä¢	Perf budgets and coverage (if customers ask).
	‚Ä¢	Deeper insights: flaky test detector, module build hot-spots, time-to-first-test.

‚∏ª

Working notes / pro tips
	‚Ä¢	Keep PR comment sacred: it is the product for 80% of users.
	‚Ä¢	Prefer boring tech over cleverness (especially around billing/auth).
	‚Ä¢	Measure daily; change one thing at a time.
	‚Ä¢	If you get stuck >2 hours on any task, skip and keep momentum‚Äîyou can backfill later.
