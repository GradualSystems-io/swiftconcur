Goal: Seed assistant workflow and docs consistency

What we did:
- Clarified base rules and working norms
- Updated context with environment constraints and repo map
- Enhanced starter prompts with wrap-up flow
- Added sessions summary template
- Renamed workflow `.github/workflows/cy.yml` to `ci.yml`

Key decisions/assumptions:
- Use `ci.yml` as the canonical workflow filename
- Maintain session logs under `docs/assistant/sessions/`

Changes:
- docs/assistant/base_rules.md
- docs/assistant/context.md
- docs/assistant/starter_prompts.md
- docs/assistant/sessions/README.md
- docs/assistant/sessions/2025-08-28.md
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (renamed from cy.yml)

Open questions:
- Any external references or badges that still point to `cy.yml`?
- Do we want a validation check that enforces workflow filename conventions?

Next steps:
- Confirm CI still runs under the new filename
- Optionally add a status badge referencing `ci.yml` in README
