Kickoff (new session):

“Apply docs/assistant/base_rules.md. Use docs/assistant/context.md. Goal: <one sentence>. Constraints: <bullets>. Please propose a 3–6 step plan and confirm assumptions.”

Return after a gap:

“Read docs/assistant/sessions/<last>.md, then propose next steps. If anything is unclear, ask 2–3 targeted questions.”

Wrap-up (end of session):

“Summarize this session in docs/assistant/sessions/<today>.md (decisions, files changed, next steps). If the file doesn’t exist, create it.”
